abstract: |
  This research explores the application of stochastic differential equations to uncertainty modeling in graph neural networks (GNNs). The proposed approach enhances the expressiveness of GNNs by incorporating continuous stochastic processes in the representation learning process, which improves the network's ability to handle uncertainty in graph-structured data.

summary: |
  A preprint on uncertainty quantification in graph neural networks, focusing on incorporating stochastic processes.
