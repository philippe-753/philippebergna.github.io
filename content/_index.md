        <span style="color: black;">Philippe Bergna is a Research Scientist at Advai, where he collaborated with the UK Ministry of Defence to develop advanced 3D adversarial patches that deceive state-of-the-art object detection models. He was also employed to infiltrate the UKâ€™s leading facial verification system, iProov, using transferable adversarial attacks, achieving a 55% success rate. Beyond these accomplishments, Philippe's interests extend beyond red teaming; his latest research focuses on utilising adversarial attacks as tools. For example, he has employed adversarial attacks for active learning to measure uncertainty and is currently exploring adversarial reprogramming for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. These efforts reflect his commitment to enhancing the safety and robustness of AI systems.</span>
