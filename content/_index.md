        <span style="color: black;">Richard Bergna is a first-year PhD student in Advanced Machine Learning at the Cambridge Computentional and Biological Learning Group (CBL), under the supervision of Prof. Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato and Prof. Pietro LiÃ². His research focuses on uncertainty quantification in machine learning, with applications in decision-making under uncertainty, Gaussian processes, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Previously, he completed his MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at Cambridge and graduated with first-class honors from the University of Bristol in Engineering Mathematics.</span>
