This project is a hands-on exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5, powered by LangChain and FAISS.  
It indexes a curated set of AI safety research papers to enable grounded responses from a custom chatbot.

The goal was to deepen my understanding of:
- **RAG architecture and design**
- **LLM deployment pipelines**
- **LangChain and FAISS vector search**
- **Web integration via FastAPI + HTML/JS**

Although this version doesnâ€™t yet use Docker or AWS, they are on the roadmap as part of continued efforts to sharpen my software engineering skills and deploy LLM applications in production environments.
